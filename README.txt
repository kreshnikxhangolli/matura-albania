This RShiny web application enables Albanian high school graduates to use a naive
classifier to calculate their chances of being admitted to Albanian public universities. 
Please read "Full_Project_Report.pdf" for more details.

This is the Full version of the project containing all the files. This version has been uploaded to demonstrate
the data wrangling part of the project. We do not recommend to use this version to run the application.
